# film-database

My 2nd semester university project written in C++. Implements a linked list based database (saved into a file) mainly focusing on basic object oriented principles and manual algorithm implementation. The program can be intuitively controlled in console.

Since the creaton of the project i had other extensive experiences in C++ and object oriented programming.
